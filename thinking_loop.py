"""
thinking_loop.py — RUMI Multi-Pass Reasoning Module
======================================================
Inspired by OpenMythos / Recurrent-Depth Transformer architecture.

Instead of responding immediately to complex requests, RUMI runs the input
through multiple reasoning passes — each refining the understanding, breaking
down sub-tasks, and planning the execution before the main session acts.

Simple/casual requests skip this entirely to keep latency low.
Complex/multi-step requests get 2-3 reasoning passes before execution.
